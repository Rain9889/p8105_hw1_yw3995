# Problem 1

## Load the dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

- Description
  - In this dataset, variables including **origin, year, month, day,
    hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
    pressure, visib, time_hour**.
  - the size of the dataset is **358** rows \* **15** cols.
  - the mean temperature is **39.5821229**.

## Scatterplot of time_hour and temp

``` r
hour_temp_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
hour_temp_plot
```

- Description
  - From 1:00 on January 1, 2013 to 22:00 on January 15, 2013, the
    **temperature** continued to fluctuate up and down with **time**, in
    general showed an upward trend. The maximum temperature reached
    around 57 degrees at 11 o’clock on January 14, and then dropped
    rapidly.
  - The **humidity** fluctuates between 36.82 and 100, with the highest
    average humidity at around 100 from January 11 to 14.

# Problem 2

## Create a data frame

``` r
sample_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = c(norm_samp > 0),
  vec_character = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level2", "Level1", "Level2", "Level3", "Level1", "Level3", "Level1"))
)
```

## Mean of the data frame

- Mean of each variable
  - The mean of a random sample is **-0.0106825**.
  - The mean of a logical vector is **0.5**.
  - The mean of a character vector is **NA**.
  - The mean of a factor vector is **NA**.
- Result
  - Random sample and logical vector have the mean value, but character
    and factor vector do not.

## Convert variables

``` r
as.numeric pull(sample_df, vec_logical)
as.numeric pull(sample_df, vec_character)
as.numeric pull(sample_df, vec_factor)
```

- Results
  - I can see the Warning messages about “vec_character” and
    “vec_factor”, which are both **“argument is not numeric or logical:
    returning NA”**.
  - This help explain what happens when I try to take the mean, because
    “vec_character” and “vec_factor” are not numeric or logical, R
    cannot recognize and calculate.
