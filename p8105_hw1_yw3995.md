  - In this dataset, variables including **origin, year, month, day,
    hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
    pressure, visib, time_hour**.
  - the size of the dataset is **358** rows \* **15** cols.
  - the mean temperature is **39.5821229**.

## Scatterplot of time_hour and temp

``` r
hour_temp_plot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
hour_temp_plot
```
